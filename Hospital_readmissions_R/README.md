## Hospital_readmissions_R
The project is devoted to the creation of the readmissions model for diabetic patients at Great River Medical Center. The hospital has collected information related to their ailment, medicine intake, and physician information, and wants to know if there are interesting cohorts within patient groups that may increase the probability of readmission. The goal is to create a machine learning model that identifies the patients most likely to return to the hospital after treatment, and to identify the top 100 patients among the test set that are expected to return. After identifying the top 100 patients it is necessary to analyze them and provide insights as well as recommendations.
