Projects from my Master's Degree in Business Analytics
## Creating Persona in R
The project was to conduct an exploratory analysis of the loyalty customer base of the Bedding Bathing & Yonder Company to create micro-segments and personas. It was necessary to clean and enrich the data, identify insights, and present them in a visually appealing way. The goal is to uncover interesting data relationships and correlations that can be used for targeted marketing.
