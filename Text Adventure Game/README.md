Projects from my Master's Degree in Business Analytics

## Text Adventure Game
The task is to design a text-based adventure game. My game is based on the TV Show "Game of Thrones"(actions take place in the season 5,6). The user plays for Arya Stark and has to find the House of Black and White to start training as a Faceless Man. The main goal is to pass all three stages and survive.
Rounds
- Reach Braavos
- Trainings to become a Faceless Man
- Identity struggles and loyalty to the Faceless Man
