## Analyzing Customer Churn
In this project, me and my team performed as consultants for a business concerned about high customer churn. We were provided with a dataset on customers and used it to build a model predicting churn. The objective was to identify the relevant parameters that impact churn and provide recommendations based on the analysis and model performance.
